Library Management Page using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Firebase

I'm excited to present my latest projectâ€”a user-friendly Library Management Website that simplifies book tracking and access. With features like a login page, book search powered by **Google API**, sorting options, and a cart, this website optimizes library operations and improves the user experience.

**Login Page**
A secure login page ensures authorized access for administrators, librarians, and users. It maintains privacy and manages user accounts.

**About Page** 
Provides an overview of the library's goals and services.

**Service Provider Page**
Showcases the library's offerings, such as book borrowing and reservation.

**Contact Us Page** 
A way for users to easily get in touch with library staff for assistance or feedback.

**Dashboard** 
The central hub for book management.

          a. Book Search: Users can find books by searching for authors, titles, or keywords, thanks to the Google Books API integration.

          b. Sorting Options: Books can be sorted alphabetically by title or author name for easy browsing.

          c. Cart Functionality: Users can add books to a cart for later reference or borrowing.

**Firebase Integration**
Secure user authentication and data management using Firebase.

This Library Management Website streamlines book tracking and accessibility. It empowers libraries to improve their operations and helps users easily discover and engage with books. I'm proud to have contributed my web development expertise to this project, ensuring a smooth and intuitive experience.
